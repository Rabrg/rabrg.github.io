### Nature

> "Nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere." - **Blaise Pascal**

Nature is the universe; reality. It is everything that ever has and ever will exist. It is both physical phenomena, and the principles that govern them.

### Truth

> "Truth shall spring out of the earth..." - **Psalm 85:11**

Truth is an accurate representation of reality; it's a faithfulness to nature.

### Understanding

> "It is the marriage of the soul with Nature that makes the intellect fruitful, and gives birth to imagination." - **Walden, Henry David Thoreau**

Understanding is comprehending truth; to carry nature genuinely in the mind. New understandings are built from the old’s. Without the prerequisite understandings, a truth is incomprehensible. Understanding is meaning-making.

### Beauty

> “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all \ Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." - **Ode on a Grecian Urn, John Keats**

Beauty is a synonym of meaning; the product of understanding. The deeper the understanding, the greater the beauty. It is subjective in the way understanding is; it is objective in the way truth is. Beauty isn’t the visual features of a painting, nor the symbols in an equation, but the resonance of them with their observer.

### Techne

> "The true philosopher and the true poet are one, and a beauty, which is truth, and a truth, which is beauty, is the aim of both." - **Nature, Ralph Waldo Emerson**

Art and science are means of exploring and expressing the essence of nature; of using understanding to converge on the asymptote of truth; of creating beauty.
